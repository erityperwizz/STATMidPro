# **Welcome to Our Data Redesigning Project**

This website presents the redesign of data visualizations aimed at improving clarity, insight and interactivity. Created by Jeevani Bhaskar and Erica Mathias, this website showcases a range of visualizations using R.

### **Overview of Pages**

-   Introduction (Current Page): An overview of the website and its goals

-   Visualization Redesign (Page 2): The original visualization is transformed into two distinct visualizations, each emphasizing a better version of original visualization with enhanced interpretation.

-   Interactive Map Redesign (Page 3): This page features an interactive map, design of the original map, allowing to explore the data dynamically.

### Additional Resources

-   Code Repository (Page 4): All the codes used to create these visualization is available in this page, allowing for full reproducibility and further exploration.

-   Future Scope and References (Page 5): What comes next? What other improvements can be made? Along with the references, these questions are addressed on this page.

-   Video Presentation (Page 5) : A link to the video presentation, where we explain the rationale behind each redesign and discuss our findings, is available for a more in-depth understanding of the project.

We hope you find our visualizations insightful and engaging. Feel free to explore each page and review the resources we have included.

Thank you for visiting!
